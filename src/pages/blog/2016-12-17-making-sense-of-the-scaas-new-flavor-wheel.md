I had the idea to start this site about perimenopause stories over a year ago \[a lot has happened since then].

The irony is, the symptoms of perimenopause that gave me the idea to create the Erratic Cycles website also meant I didn't actually make the website ... ok, to be completely clear - my lack of achievement was largely due to good old I'll-do-it-tomorrow-ness, of course.
