I had the idea to start this site about perimenopause stories over a year ago \[a lot has happened since then].

The irony is, the symptoms of perimenopause that gave me the idea to create the Erratic Cycles website also meant I didn't actually make the website ... ok, to be completely clear - my lack of achievement was largely due to good old putting it off/finding excuses, of course.

So, as an introduction, I'm going to list my symptoms. Some may be due to the perimenopause. Some may not. I'm no doctor.

**Brain fog** - inability to make lots of decisions, feeling like my brain has started wearing thick cement boots, covered in soft fur

**Irritability** - not new, but I'm now taking this opportunity to blame it on perimenopause instead of my star sign :)

**Hot flushes** - yes, these lovely ladies.  I actually *like* being hot and sweaty, It makes me feel like I'm on holiday. But I have taken to ripping of my t-shirt / covers at night and lying there panting and wondering why there's no mosquito net or the sounds of palm trees and waves outside my window. Which leads me nicely to...

INSOMNIA - again, not new. But it's changed - I used to get up twice a night for a wee (I drink too much water), now I get up three times and lie there panting - t-shirt on, t-shirt off - heart racing, wide awake... it's very boring. 

***\[Hot flush break]***

Anxiety / depression. Ugh - who can be bothered. They come and go. I think I'll leave that to another day.

And of course, the reason for the name of this website - drum roll - **erratic cycles** - periods that pop in like a forgetful aunt (i.e. me) whenever they remember. And when they do come, they sometimes bring their friends and have a party in my pants, lasting for days or weeks. The thunderous rush of another gush. Other times, the period just sticks its head round the door - "coo-ee, just messing with you!!" and then off it goes.\

I would really love to hear about your experiences.  See you soon.
